        bring a guest with them to this table as long as they are consuming a peanut free lunch.
        <br><br>
        - Students are to remain seated with their legs under the table
        <br><br>

        - Students must ask for permission and use the sign out sheet to use the restroom.
        <br><br>
        - Students are not allowed to share or trade their food with other students due to allergies.
        <br><br>
        - Students are responsible to throw away all trash and clean up their area before they leave the cafeteria
        (on top of the table and on the floor under their table where they are sitting).
        <br><br>
        - At the end of lunch, students will line up quietly when their class is called, and exit the cafeteria with
        their aid to go outside."

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organized and more efficient than they have been in the past.
        Online Menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses
        the cafeteria could be provided with a School Cateen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirments they might have. Ordering online by ticketing a 
        box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handeling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

      <h4>Implemented Online Attendence Managment System</h4>
      <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5  col-xs-12">
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

        Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.
        
        To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work.
        
        An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.
